## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm start
3. Click on BoardViewer.html
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of function algorithms. There is a 4x4 chessboard showing 4 queens. When the 4 queens are place in any way, the board will show if there are any conflicts between the queens in a way where they are compromised.

When the pieces do not compromise each other, the board will not show any highlights.

When the board has issues, the rows, columns, diaganols will highlight in red.
