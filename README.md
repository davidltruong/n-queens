## Background

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```sh
1. $ npm install --global
2. $ npm start
3. Click on BoardViewer.html
```

## Usage

This project is to showcase the use of function algorithms. There is a 4x4 chessboard showing 4 queens. When the 4 queens are place in any way, the board will show if there are any conflicts between the queens in a way where they are compromised.
